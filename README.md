multithreading bst
"Hello all,

find the assignment in pdf and the respective code in ca2.zip. This extends assignment 1 to a multiprocessor program. Details are in the assignment. For questions, please use the MS teams channel

The model answer for Assignment 1 which can be used for this assignment is found bst.c.

Kind regards - the team"

 -But model answer didn't work for majority of the time we had to work on the assignment, had to make changes to own assignment1 code to get it to work differently so that it was in line with the requirements for this assignment. model code was updated multiple times so might work now
